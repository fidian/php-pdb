<p>When using this test, make sure to have a freshly loaded copy of the file
on your palm and make sure that the first program to open it is your DOC
reader.  If you don't, the database can be altered and you would be getting
inaccurate results.</p>

<p>For instance, if you create a DOC file with embedded bookmarks and you
run it through AportisDOC, it will scan the file and create stored
bookmarks.  Then, if you open it with another DOC reader, you might think
that embedded bookmarks are supported, even if the program only supports
stored bookmarks.</p>

<p>The easiest way to avoid being tricked is to just download and HotSync a
new copy of the test for each type of bookmark for each DOC reader you wish
to test.</p>
