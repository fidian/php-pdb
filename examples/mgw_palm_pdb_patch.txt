This was a patch submitted by Christoph Barth <cbarth at urbanet dot ch>
for adding export to Palm support to moregroupware.

It was submitted on January 21, 2002.  Things may have changed since then.

It was created with
   moregroupware, release 0.5.5 (CVS)
   php-pdb, likely version 1.2.0 or another version released at about that
      time
   Linux, 2.4.10-4GB
   PHP, version 4.0.6
   Palm III, Palm OS version 3.3

I haven't actually tried it.  Your mileage may vary.

PHP-PDB is actually included with this patch.

No instructions were given to me about installation.  A "cleaned" version
was proposed, but it never materialized, so this is the best I can do.
