<P>PHP-PDB can create nearly any type of <a
href="http://www.palmos.com/">Palm OS</a> database through the most basic
functions, as illustrated here.  If you want to write a format of database
that isn't directly supported by a module, I would suggest you check out the
<a href="custom.php">Custom Formats</a> page.</p>

<h3>Including into your program</h3>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
include \'php-pdb.inc\';
');

?>

<h3>Creating a new database</h3>

<P>To create a new database, you need to find out the correct type and
creator ID to make the database with.  You should also specify the name of
the database.</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
$DB = new PalmDB("Type", "Creator", "Name Of Database");
  // Typical usage
  
$pdb = new PalmDB();
  // Special:  If you want to create an instance of the class
  // and then use ReadFile() to load the database information
');

?>

<h3>Writing the database</h3>

<p><b>Writing to a file:</b>  It might be important to open the file with
<tt>wb</tt> as the mode.  Unix, Linux, and others don't care about the
'<tt>b</tt>', but all versions of Windows do care.</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
// Writing to a file
$fp = fopen("output_file.pdb", "wb");
if (! $fp) exit;  // There was an error opening the file
$pdb->WriteToFile($fp);
fclose($fp);
');

?>

<p><b>Writing to stdout:</b>  If you want the file to just be piped to the
standard output, as though you were just using <tt>echo</tt> to dump the
file, it is a bit simpler.</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
// Writing to standard output
$pdb->WriteToStdout();
');

?>

<p><b>Download through browser:</b>  If your PHP script just generates a
.pdb file to be downloaded through the browser, you can just call this
function and it will generate the correct file download headers and send the
file to the browser.  Only call this function if you didn't already send any
content.  There are a few known issues with IE and file downloads, so the
headers that are generated should work with the newest versions of IE and
might not work with older ones.  It's not my fault -- see Microsoft
technical support.</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
// Download through browser
// Specify filename you want the .pdb saved as on the remote computer
$pdb->DownloadPDB("filename.pdb");
');

?>

<h3>Loading the database</h3>

<p>This function reads data from the opened file and tries to load it
properly.  Returns false if there is no error.</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
// Create a dummy instance of the class
$pdb = new PalmDB("test", "test");
// Load a file
$fp = fopen("your_file.pdb", "r");
$pdb->ReadFile($fp);
fclose($fp);

// Show information about the database
echo "Name: $addr->Name<br>\n";
echo "Type: $addr->TypeID<br>";
echo "Creator: $addr->CreatorID<br>\n";
echo "Attributes: $addr->Attributes<br>\n";
echo "Version: $addr->Version<br>\n";
echo "ModNum: $addr->ModNumber<br>\n";
echo "CreationTime: $addr->CreationTime<br>\n";
echo "ModTime: $addr->ModificationTime<br>\n";
echo "BackTime: $addr->BackupTime<br>\n";
echo "NumRec: ".$addr->GetRecordCount()."<br>\n";
$recids = $addr->GetRecordIDs();
foreach ($recids as $ID) {
  $record = $addr->GetRecordRaw($ID);
  echo "Record $ID:<BR>";
  // Depending on what the record stored, you might be able to do this:
  // echo "- Data: " . $record
}
');

?>

<h3>Category Support and Record Attributes</h3>

<p>If you plan on using categories, you will need to understand a bit of
tricky information.  The attributes byte also has the category information
in it.  The lower four bits (0x0F) usually are the category number (0 - 15),
but if the record is deleted or expunged, then it is no longer category
information and the fourth bit (0x08) is a flag for if the record should be
archived or not.  This may be a bit confusing, so here's some code to help
you out:</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
// Get the record attributes
$attr = $pdb->GetRecordAttrib();

// If the record is deleted or expunged ...
if ($attr & PDB_RECORD_ATTRIB_DEL_EXP) {
   // Check if the record should be archived
   if ($attr & PDB_RECORD_ATTRIB_ARCHIVE)
      echo "Record is deleted/expunged and should be archived.\n";
   else
      echo "Record is deleted/expunged and should not be archived.\n";
} else {
   // If the record is not deleted/expunged, then the lower four
   // bits are the category number.
   echo "Record is not deleted/expunged.\n";
   echo "Record category number = " . ($attr & PDB_CATEGORY_MASK) . "\n";
}
');

?>

<p>This little bit of code might help you figure out more information about
the attributes.</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
$attrib = $pdb->GetRecordAttrib();

// Show which attributes are there
if ($attrib & PDB_ADDR_ATTRIB_EXPUNGED) echo "Record is expunged.<br>\n";
if ($attrib & PDB_ADDR_ATTRIB_DELETED) echo "Record is deleted.<br>\n";
if ($attrib & PDB_ADDR_ATTRIB_DIRTY) echo "Record is dirty.<br>\n";
if ($attrib & PDB_ADDR_ATTRIB_PRIVATE) echo "Record is private.<br>\n";
if ($attrib & PDB_ADDR_ATTRIB_DEL_EXP) {
   // The archive bit is only set if the record is deleted or expunged.
   // Otherwise, the lower bits specify the category.
   if ($attrib & PDB_ADDR_ATTRIB_ARCHIVE) 
      echo "Record is marked to be archived.<br>\n";
}
');

?>

<p>In order to define/see what the 16 categories are, you use the
SetCategoryList() and GetCategoryList() functions.  See SetCategoryList()
for special rules that apply to the array of data.  If you wish to include
category support in your module/application, you will need to create an
extender class and add LoadAppInfo() and GetAppInfo() functions which
load/save the category data correctly:</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
// LoadAppInfo() example
function LoadAppInfo($fileData) {
   // Load category data
   $this->LoadCategoryData($fileData);
   // Skip past category data
   $fileData = substr($fileData, PDB_CATEGORY_SIZE);
   
   // .... rest of your code goes here
}


// GetAppInfo() example
function GetAppInfo() {
   $AppInfo = $this->CreateCategoryData();
   
   // .... rest of your code goes here
   // .... append data to the $AppInfo string
   
   return $AppInfo;
}
');

?>

<p>Here is a more thorough example that illustrates how the category 
numbers, category IDs, records, attributes and various other things
all work together.  For this to work properly, make sure that there is a
file called AddressDB.pdb and make sure that it is an address book 
database.</p>

<?PHP

ShowExample('
include "php-pdb.inc";            // Load PHP-PDB class
include "modules/addrbook.inc";   // Load Addressbook module

// Load address book
$addr = new PalmAddress();
$fp = fopen("AddressDB.pdb","r");
$addr->ReadFile($fp);
fclose($fp);

// Fill the data array with entries from the address book.
// The key will be the name of the person or company.
// The value will be the category name and category ID.

$data = array();
foreach ($addr->RecordAttrs as $key => $val)
{
    // Get the category and record arrays to have quicker, cleaner
    // access to the data
    $cat = $addr->CategoryList[$val & PDB_CATEGORY_MASK];
    $rec = $addr->Records[$key];

    // Build the key for the $data array
    $Index = $rec["LastName"] . ", " . $rec["FirstName"] . " @ " .
      $rec["Company"];
    $Index = trim($Index);
    if ($rec["LastName"] == "")
      $Index = $rec["FirstName"] . " @ " . $rec["Company"];
      
    // Build the value for the $data array
    $Cate =  $cat["Name"] . "(" . $cat["ID"] . ")";
    
    // Add entry
    $data[$Index] = $Cate;
}

// Sort alphabetically
ksort($data);

// Dump the data
foreach ($data as $key => $val)
  echo $key . " ---> " . $val . "\n";
');

?>

<h3>Other functions</h3>

<p>This is not a comprehensive list.  There are other functions in the main
class, but they are primarily used for converting data and would be best
used in modules.  Read the source if you want to see what the rest of the
functions are.</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>GoToRecord($num = false)</b></dt>
<dd>If $num is not specified, returns the current record number.</dd>
<dd>If $num is specified and is a string with '+' or '-' as its first
character, jumps ahead or back the specified number of records.  Returns the
old record number.</dd>
<dd>If $num is a number, jumps directly to the specified record.  Returns
the old record number.</dd>

<dt><b>GetRecordSize($num = false)</b></dt>
<dd>If $num is not specified, returns the size of the current record.</dd>
<dd>If $num is specified, returns the size of the specified record.</dd>

<dt><b>AppendInt8($value)</b></dt>
<dd>Appends a single byte to the current record.</dd>

<dt><b>AppendInt16($value)</b></dt>
<dd>Appends an integer (two bytes) to the current record.</dd>

<dt><b>AppendInt32($value)</b></dt>
<dd>Appends a long (four bytes) to the current record.</dd>

<dt><b>AppendDouble($value)</b></dt>
<dd>Appends a double (eight bytes, floating point) to the current record.</dd>

<dt><b>AppendString($string, $maxLen = false)</b></dt>
<dd>Appends a string to the current record.  The string is not null
terminated.  If $maxLen is specified and is greater than zero, the string is
trimmed and will contain up to $maxLen characters.</dd>

<dt><b>RecordExists($record = false)</b></dt>
<dd>If $record is not specified, returns true if the current record exists
and is set.</dd>
<dd>If $record is specified, returns true if the specified record exists and
is set.</dd>

<dt><b>GetRecord($record = false)</b></dt>
<dd>Returns the data for the record, or the current record if
$record is not specified.  If the desired record doesn't contain data,
returns ''.  GetRecordRaw() might be more useful, since this may be
overridden to return compressed and/or encoded data.</dd>

<dt><b>GetRecordRaw($record = false)</b></dt>
<dd>If $record is not specified, returns the raw data of the current record,
or false if the current record doesn't yet exist.</dd>
<dd>If $record is specified, returns the raw data of the record, or false if
the record doesn't exist.</dd>

<dt><b>SetRecordRaw($data)</b></dt>
<dd>Sets the raw data for the current record to be $data.

<dt><b>SetRecordRaw($record, $data)</b></dt>
<dd>Sets the raw data for $record to be $data.</dd>

<dt><b>DeleteCurrentRecord()</b></dt>
<dd>Erases and unsets the current record</dd>

<dt><b>GetRecordIDs()</b></dt>
<dd>Returns a list of the set record IDs in the order that they should be
written.</dd>

<dt><b>GetRecordCount()</b></dt>
<dd>Returns the number of records.  This should match the number of keys
returned by GetRecordIDs().</dd>

<dt><b>GetCategoryList()</b></dt>
<dd>Returns an array containing the different categories.  See
SetCategoryList() for the format of the array.</dd>

<dt><b>SetCategoryList($data)</b></dt>
<dd>Sets the categories to what you specified.  $data is in one of two
different formats:</dd>
<dd><?PHP

ShowExample('
// Easy way:
$data[$id] = "Name";

// Harder, but this is how GetCategoryList() returns data
$data[$id] = array(\'Name\' => "Name",
                   \'Renamed\' => false);
		   
/* $id is a number from 0 to 15.
 * "Name" is the category\'s name
 * The Renamed flag is true/false.  Not sure what it does.
 */
');

?></dd>
<dd>Tips/Rules:<br>
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest numbering your categories sequentially.</li>
<li>Do not have a category 0.  It must always be the 'Unfiled' category.
If you do specify a category 0, then it will merely be overwritten.</li>
<li>There's a maximum of 16 categories, including 'Unfiled'.  This means
that you only have 15 to play with.</li>
<li>Categories 1-127 are typically reserved for handheld ID numbers</li>
<li>Categories 128-255 are used for desktip ID numbers</li>
<li>Do not let categories be created with ID numbers larger than 255 -- they
will be ignored/erased.</li>
<li>I'd strongly suggest not using a number higher than about 240.  You are
given 16 categories.  If you don't use them all, blank ones are added to the
end, and they are given sequentially larger numbers from the last ID found.
This means that if you use an ID of 255 and you didn't use all of your 15
categories that you can change, then a blank one with an ID of 256 will be
added.  This error is caught but not corrected, and all of the category data
will not be written when the file is saved/written to the browser.</li>
</ul>
<li>If you just want to set the categories quickly, you can use code like
this:<br><tt>$pdb->SetCategoryList(array(1 => 'Category1', 'Category2',
'Etc.'))</dd>

<dt><b>CreateCategoryData()</b></dt>
<dd>Looks at the category information stored in the class and creates the
proper hex-encoded data for the AppInfo block.</dd>

<dt><b>LoadCategoryData($fileData)</b></dt>
<dd>Used when loading data from a file.  Reads in a chunk of the AppInfo
block into the class's data structures.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>More information</h3>

<p>The source code is pretty clean with lots of comments strewn about.
There are other functions that are not detailed here and are designed to be
overridden by classes that extend the base class.  Read the source to get to
