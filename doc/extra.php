<ul>
<li>Arensburger, Andrew -- Thanks for making <a
   href="http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/">P5-Palm</a>!  I used 
   several ideas when creating PHP-PDB, and a few comments really helped me
   out.</li>
<li>Dittgen, Pierre -- His <a 
   href="http://mmmm.free.fr/palm/download/">palmlib</a> (aka ToPTIP) was
   handy to have around when initially adding DOC support.</li>
