<h3>Making sure PHP-PDB works</h3>

<p>After you installed PHP-PDB somewhere, just use your web browser and view
<tt>pdb-test.php</tt>.  It will perform a few tests and tell you the results
of the tests.  They should all say <font color=green>pass</font>.  If they
don't, contact me for help.</p>

<h3>Contact information</h3>

<p>I finally have mailing lists set up.  If you are asking for help, please
subscribe to the mailing list and ask your question.  Your answer should
come to you pretty fast.  If you abhore mailing lists and would rather have
something painful happen to you instead of subscribing to a mailing list,
just email me directly.  I'll simply forward your request to the mailing
list and then ask that the list members reply to you and to the list.  My
email address is (fidian at tiny dot net).</p>

<h3>Legalese</h3>

<P>PHP-PDB is released under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</a> and is basically
free to use for everyone.</p>

<h3>Credits and thanks</h3>

<li>Arensburger, Andrew -- Thanks for making <a
   href="http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/">P5-Palm</a>!  I used 
   several ideas when creating PHP-PDB, and a few comments really helped me
   out.</li>
<li>Dittgen, Pierre -- His <a 
   href="http://mmmm.free.fr/palm/download/">palmlib</a> (aka ToPTIP) was
   handy to have around when initially adding DOC support.</li>
